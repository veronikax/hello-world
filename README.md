# hello-world
First repository on GitHub for testing purposes
My name is Veronika, I am from Europe - Czech Republic, but living in Brazil for 8 years. 
I am graduated in IT with focus on IT management & modeling, I always worked between the client and the developers, now I want to learn to code myself to be able to build my own projects. 
I want to learn SQL, PHP, Python, JavaScript, HTML/CSS ... and Im interested to work on functional projects and apps. 
I understand well the overall logic & grasp the complexity fast, it is easy for me to model the algorithms. Where Im getting lost is mostly the syntax and using all of those different tools & technology.
